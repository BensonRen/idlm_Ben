1. Created folder /Documents/Ben as my operating folder
2. Put everything I need inside that folder using SFTP
3. Updated Conda packages using “conda upgrade —all” (Otherwise the tensorflow-gpu installation would fail)
4. Updated a python package <wrapt> using “conda update wrapt” (Otherwise the tensorflow-gpu installation would fail)
5. Install tensorflow gpu version using “pip install tensorflow-gpu”
6. Right now the tensorflow version would be “1.14.0” with gpu enabled
7. Vim installed using “sudo apt install vim”
8. Vim configuration file added ~/.vim and ~/.vimrc
9. Added alias Ben=‘cd ~/Documents/Ben; ls; echo Keep working Ben’ to ~/.bashrc
10. .bashrc copied to ~/Documents/Ben/2019.08/0805/Backprop/ for reference
11. Updated Scikit-learn package using “conda upgrade scikit-learn”
12. Install email system “sudo apt install mailutils” “sudo apt-get install sendemail libio-socket-ssl-perl libnet-ssleay-perl”
13. Install SKlearn package for ML “pip install sklearn”
14. Changed ~/.vimrc settings to fit python writing usage
15. Applied a google account for Cerus. 

Currently I am using 3 ways (separately or combined) to connect to Cerus:
1. SSH: Built-in “terminal” for Mac
2. SFPT: A free licensed FTP app “FileZilla”
3. Remote Desktop: Official desktop app from Microsoft “Microsoft Remote Desktop”
