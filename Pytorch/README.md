# Pytorch implementation of the whole repo

This is a transition starting from Nov. 20, 2019

# Developer Log:

### RoadMap for this work:
1. Transition the major infra-structure from tensorflow to pytorch
2. Implement a GAN network for meta-material project

## 2019.11.20
Background: Start Pytorch transition. GAN model (not in previous tf repo) would be the first model to work on.

Todo:
1. Construct the network main class wrapper for GAN
2. Handle the data reader transition to pytorch
3. W
