# Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)

## Method Description
This is an interesting generative model inspired by the normal Auto-Encoder. By using a variational baysian for the implicit latent variable Z, it generate structures that emulate the input training X,Y pairs.

## Loss function
TBC....

**Boundary Loss**: The Loss that describes our desired range of geometer parameters. If it is out of range, punish it by this loss.

**Prediction Loss**: Normal MSE loss for evaluating the accuracy of the prediciton. 

## Results:
Currently doing hyper-parameters swapping. Results to be continued.......
